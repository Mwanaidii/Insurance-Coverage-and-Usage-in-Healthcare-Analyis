## Project Overview
Access to healthcare is a fundamental human right, yet significant disparities remain, particularly regarding health insurance coverage. Health insurance plays a crucial role in ensuring individuals can afford and access necessary medical services without facing catastrophic financial burdens. Despite its importance, many individuals remain uninsured, often due to socioeconomic barriers such as employment status and income levels. This analysis aims to explore the patterns of health insurance coverage, the influence of socioeconomic factors on insurance access, and how insurance status affects healthcare utilization, particularly hospital visits. By analyzing these dynamics, we can provide meaningful insights to inform stakeholders in developing strategies to improve health insurance penetration and promote healthcare equity.

## Problem Statement
The project focuses on addressing critical questions regarding healthcare access through insurance, specifically:

Percentage of individuals with health insurance.

Influence of employment and income on insurance access.

Hospital visit frequency differences between insured and uninsured individuals.

## Objectives:
The goal of this project is to deeply analyze the factors influencing health insurance coverage and hospital visit behaviors among different socioeconomic groups. Specifically, the project aims to:

1.Measure the proportion of individuals with and without health insurance.

2.Explore how employment status and household income impact access to insurance.

3.Compare hospital visit patterns between insured and uninsured individuals.

Provide actionable insights to healthcare policymakers and stakeholders to design targeted interventions that improve healthcare access and equity.

## Scope of Work
This project will involve:

Cleaning and preprocessing the healthcare survey dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends.

Visualizing key metrics for easy stakeholder interpretation.

Conducting statistical analysis to uncover significant relationships between socioeconomic factors and insurance status.

Summarizing key findings and providing data-driven recommendations.



## Assumptions and Key Insights
Data Limitations: 

o The dataset may not represent the entire population, potentially skewing results.

Self-Reported Bias: 

o Variables like income and hospital visits are self-reported and may contain inaccuracies.

Temporal Context: 

o The analysis reflects a specific period and may not capture ongoing trends.

Unmeasured Variables:

o Factors like regional healthcare policies and cultural differences were not accounted for.

## Key Insights  Insights

1. Percentage of individuals with health insurance: 57.96% of the individuals are insured which is a sightly higher number than those not insured.

2. Influence income levels on insurance acces;Higher income groups have a higher proportion of insured individuals, while lower-income groups are mostly uninsured. Insurance coverage clearly increases with income level.

3. Influence of Employment levels on insurance access: Employed individuals have the highest insurance coverage (nearly 80%). Unemployed individuals are mostly uninsured (about 66%), showing a clear link between employment and insurance access.

4. Assess the impact of health insurance on hospital visit frequency; Uninsured people visit hospitals more often than the insured, likely due to lack of access to preventive care, leading to more emergency or severe cases.

# Other areas analysed were;

5. The age and gender with frequency of hospital visits; More females visited the hospitals and the hospital visits decreased with increase n age.

6. Age and gender hat have undergone cancer Screening; More females underwent Cancer Screening and the number increased with increase in Age.

7. Marital status against insured and uninsured; Most married people and divorced had insurance while most sing people did not have.
